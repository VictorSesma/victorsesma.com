I’m Victor Sesma. I build backend systems and I care about clean architecture, reliability, and pragmatic engineering.

This site is where I document what I learn while designing and shipping systems—especially where AI changes the shape of backend work. I’m not interested in hype or “AI demos”. I’m interested in **constraints, failure modes, and trade-offs**.

## What I work on

- Backend architecture and distributed systems (often in Go)
- Reliability: observability, incident-minded design, production ergonomics
- Applied AI systems: constrained assistants, RAG, human-in-the-loop workflows

## How I think

I like approaches that are:
- **Explainable**: you can reason about behavior and failure cases
- **Testable**: there’s a path to confidence in production
- **Operational**: metrics, logs, and clear ownership are first-class
- **Pragmatic**: the simplest solution that meets the constraints

## What you’ll find here

- Short technical notes
- Case studies from real projects (with limitations and mistakes included)
- Architecture write-ups focused on decision-making, not buzzwords

If you want to reach out, you can find me on the social links below (or via email if you prefer).
